      Flightdeck is not configured for authentication, so it is refusing to
      serve the dashboard.

      Pick one of the following, then restart your app.

      1. HTTP Basic via environment variables:

           FLIGHTDECK_USERNAME=admin FLIGHTDECK_PASSWORD=a-long-secret

      2. HTTP Basic via Rails credentials (bin/rails credentials:edit):

           flightdeck:
             username: admin
             password: a-long-secret

      3. HTTP Basic in an initializer (config/initializers/flightdeck.rb):

           Flightdeck.configure do |config|
             config.http_basic = { username: "admin", password: "a-long-secret" }
           end

      4. Reuse your application's own authentication by giving Flightdeck a
         base controller to inherit from:

           Flightdeck.configure do |config|
             config.base_controller_class = "Admin::BaseController"
           end

      Flightdeck never serves unauthenticated requests, in any environment.
